Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability so contributors can get a sense of whether they might be excited about working on adding this functionality to `webchem`.  If you're interested in contributing code to access this database yourself, please indicate this and also see CONTRIBUTING.md

### Suggested database: <name and link to home page>

1. **Feasibility**.  Does the database provide an API?  If not, does the database allow scraping?  This information might be in an FAQ or About page.  If you can't find it, don't worry, we'll look into it.

2. **Scope**. What kind of data does the database contain? It should be primarily chemical properties, but databases of chemical identifiers or synonyms may also be considered.

3. **Overlap**.  How much does the database contents overlap with current databases that webchem can access? Does it provide unique properties and/or data on a unique set of chemicals?
