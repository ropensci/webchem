## Minimal reproducible example

Please include a minimal reproducible example (reprex). 
The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that we can fix it. 
If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://github.com/jennybc/reprex#what-is-a-reprex> or <http://tinyurl.com/reproducible-000>.
