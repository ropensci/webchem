# webchem 1.1.1.9005

## NEW FEATURES

* Retrieve data from webTEST, a Web-Services Program to Estimate Toxicity from Molecular Structure with webtest_query().

## BUG FIXES

# webchem 1.1.1.

## NEW FEATURES

* Fetch LIPID MAPS and SwissLipids identifiers from Wikidata.

## BUG FIXES

* Fix get_csid() so it doesn't break when a query is invalid.

# webchem 1.1.0.

## NEW FEATURES

* Download images of substances from Chemical Identifier Resolver (CIR) with `cir_img()`.
* Download images of substances from ChemSpider with `cs_img()`.
* `find_db()` checks if a query gets a hit in most databases integrated in webchem. Useful for deciding which of several databases to focus on given a set of chemicals.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Most functions now use httr::RETRY() to access webservices.
* Verbose messages are now harmonized.
* The `"type"` argument in `ci_query()` and `aw_query()` has been changed to `"from"` for consistency with other functions.
* `fn_percept()` and `cts_compinfo()` now have `"query"` and `"from"` arguments for consistency with other functions.
* Possible values for `"from"` have been made more consistent across functions.
* `pc_synonyms()`, `cts_convert()`, `cir_query()` have been changed to use the `match` argument instead of `choices` for consistency with other functions.
* `get_etoxid()` output changed slightly so that the matched chemical name string no longer includes the etoxid in parentheses.
* `is.cas()` is now vectorized.

## BUG FIXES

* Fix URL encoding so SMILES queries don't fail on some special characters.

# webchem 1.0.0

## NEW FEATURES

* get_cid() now can search by registry IDs (e.g. CAS RN), and can handle more complex requests like searching for similar compounds.
* Retrieve chemical data from PubChem content pages with pc_sect().
* get_etoxid() now can search by CAS, EC, GSBL and RTECS numbers. Added `from = ` argument.
* nist_ri() now can search by name, InChI, InChIKey, or CAS.  The `cas` argument is deprecated.  Use `query` instead with `from = "cas"`.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* all `get_*()` functions now output tibbles with a column for the query and a column for the retrieved ID.
* changes to arguments in `get_*()` functions to make them more consistent.
* aw_idx.rda is no longer included in the package as a data set. Instead, it is built by build_aw_idx() to tempdir().


## BUG FIXES

* nist_ri() returned malformed tables or errored if there was only one entry for a query.
* get_csid() now returns all csids when queried from formula.
* get_csid() returned an error when query was NA.

# webchem 0.5.0


## NEW FEATURES

* ChemSpider functions now look for an API token stored in .Renviron or .Rprofile by default so you can keep them hidden more easily.

## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
